# Chapter 12: Protein Structure

Understanding protein structure is key to structure-based drug design. This chapter covers protein structure basics, experimental methods, and computational prediction (e.g., AlphaFold).

## 12.1 Protein Structure Levels
## 12.2 Experimental Determination
## 12.3 Structure Prediction Tools
## 12.4 Protein-Ligand Interactions
