    "## How to Search PDB for ALS Structures with Ligands Only\n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve only ALS-related PDB entries that contain ligands (non-protein entities), you can use the RCSB PDB Advanced Search with a query that combines your gene/protein of interest and a filter for the presence of nonpolymer entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: RCSB Query JSON**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the [RCSB Query Editor](https://search.rcsb.org/query-editor.html) to build this, or use the following JSON as a template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"query\": {\n",
    "    \"type\": \"group\",\n",
    "    \"logical_operator\": \"and\",\n",
    "    \"nodes\": [\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"terminal\",\n",
    "        \"service\": \"full_text\",\n",
    "        \"parameters\": { \"value\": \"SOD1\" }\n",
    "      },\n",
    "      {\n",
    "        \"type\": \"terminal\",\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace `\"SOD1\"` with any ALS gene/protein of interest.\n",
    "- The `exists` node ensures only entries with at least one nonpolymer (ligand/ion) are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use:**\n",
    "1. Go to the [RCSB Query Editor](https://search.rcsb.org/query-editor.html).\n",
    "2. Paste the JSON above into the \"JSON\" tab.\n",
    "3. Run the query to get a list of PDB IDs with ligands for your target.\n",
    "4. Use these filtered PDB IDs in your batch extraction code.\n",
    "\n",

    "Looking over the PDB results you shared, here’s a structured assessment regarding potential relevance for drug discovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Key observations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many of your PDB entries contain **metal ions** (ZINC, COPPER, NICKEL, CALCIUM) as non-polymer entities.\n",
    "* Some entries contain **small-molecule ligands** (e.g., benzamide derivatives, Cisplatin, glycerol, MES, butane-1,4-dithiol).\n",
    "* Several entries contain **common crystallization additives or buffers** (sulfate, acetate, chloride, DMSO, glycerol).\n",
    "* Some entries had **GraphQL errors** or no non-polymer entities, so those likely are **not useful for small-molecule binding studies**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Metal ions in drug discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zinc, Copper, Nickel ions** are often cofactors for enzymes and can be targeted by **metal-chelating drugs**.\n",
    "* If a PDB shows a ligand coordinated to these metal ions, it could indicate a **druggable active site**, especially for **metalloenzymes**.\n",
    "* However, metal ions alone (without a bound organic ligand) are **less informative** for direct drug discovery—they just indicate a potential metal-binding site.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Small-molecule ligands worth noting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Cisplatin (3RE0)** → known chemotherapy drug, demonstrates metal-based drug binding.\n",
    "  * **N-phenyl-2-selanylbenzamide / related selenyl/fluoranyl-benzamides (6Z3V, 6Z4H, 6Z4I, etc.)** → these are potential inhibitors and could be explored in **enzyme inhibition assays**.\n",
    "  * **Butane-1,4-dithiol, DIMETHYL SULFOXIDE** → often crystallization additives, usually not drug candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Takeaway:** PDBs with bound **organic inhibitors** are the most promising for drug discovery; metal ions alone are secondary targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ Recommendations for prioritization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on entries with both metal ions and bound inhibitors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Examples: 6Z3V, 6Z4H, 6Z4I, 5O3Y, 5O40. These show ligands that could be optimized for drug design.\n",
    "2. **Ignore PDBs with only buffer/metal ions** (SO4, Cl, MES, GOL) unless targeting a **metal-binding enzyme**.\n",
    "3. **Check binding site conservation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use software like PyMOL, ChimeraX, or MOE to visualize ligand-metal interactions.\n",
    "   * Determine if the metal-coordinating residues are conserved across species, indicating **drug relevance**.\n",
    "4. **Validate known inhibitors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For example, selenyl-benzamides could be explored for **enzyme inhibition** if your target protein is a metalloenzyme.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Most promising PDBs** for drug discovery: those with **organic ligands bound to metal ions**.\n",
    "* **Less promising**: entries with only metal ions or buffer molecules.\n",
    "* If your goal is **hit identification**, focus on ligand-bound PDBs and consider metal-coordinating interactions as part of structure-based drug design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can **make a clean table of your PDBs ranked by potential drug discovery relevance**, highlighting which ones are likely worth pursuing first. This will make it much easier to focus your efforts.\n",
