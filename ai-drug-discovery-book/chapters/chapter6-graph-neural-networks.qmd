# Chapter 6: Graph Neural Networks

---

## Summary

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning on molecular graphs. This chapter introduces GNN concepts and their application to molecular property prediction, including how molecules are represented as graphs and how GNNs can learn from these structures.

## Key Code Snippets

### 1. Construct a Molecular Graph with RDKit and NetworkX
```python
from rdkit import Chem
import networkx as nx
smiles = "CCO"
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
G = nx.Graph()
for atom in mol.GetAtoms():
	G.add_node(atom.GetIdx(), label=atom.GetSymbol())
for bond in mol.GetBonds():
	G.add_edge(bond.GetBeginAtomIdx(), bond.GetEndAtomIdx(), type=bond.GetBondType())
```

### 2. Simple GNN Layer with PyTorch Geometric
```python
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv
import torch
conv = GCNConv(in_channels=10, out_channels=16)
x = torch.randn((num_nodes, 10))
edge_index = ...  # edge list as tensor
out = conv(x, edge_index)
```
