# Chapter 3: Cheminformatics Essentials

Cheminformatics is the foundation for representing, searching, and analyzing chemical structures computationally. This chapter covers molecular representations, file formats, and basic cheminformatics operations.

## 3.1 Molecular Representations (SMILES, InChI)

Molecular representations are ways to describe chemical structures in a form that computers can process.

- **SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System):**
	- A line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings.
	- Example: Ethanol = `CCO`, Benzene = `c1ccccc1`
	- Widely used for database storage and cheminformatics tools.

- **InChI (International Chemical Identifier):**
	- A textual identifier for chemical substances, designed to be unique and non-proprietary.
	- Example: Ethanol = `InChI=1S/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3`
	- Useful for interoperability and linking chemical information across databases.

## 3.2 Chemical File Formats

Chemical file formats store molecular structures and related data. Common formats include:

- **SDF (Structure Data File):**
	- Stores multiple molecules with associated data fields.
	- Used for compound libraries and virtual screening.

- **MOL/MOL2:**
	- Encodes 2D/3D structure, atom types, and bond information.
	- MOL2 supports more detailed atom typing and charges.

- **PDB (Protein Data Bank):**
	- Used for macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids) and some small molecules.
	- Contains 3D coordinates and metadata.

- **CSV/TSV:**
	- Tabular formats often used to store SMILES or InChI strings with associated data.

## 3.3 Structure Search and Similarity

Cheminformatics enables searching for molecules by structure and comparing their similarity.

- **Exact Structure Search:**
	- Finds molecules that are identical to a query structure.

- **Substructure Search:**
	- Finds molecules containing a specific substructure (e.g., a benzene ring).

- **Similarity Search:**
	- Finds molecules similar to a query, often using fingerprints and Tanimoto similarity.
	- Example: RDKit can compute molecular fingerprints and similarity scores.

**Example (Python/RDKit):**
```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import DataStructs, AllChem

mol1 = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CCO')
mol2 = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CCN')
fp1 = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect(mol1, 2)
fp2 = AllChem.GetMorganFingerprintAsBitVect(mol2, 2)
similarity = DataStructs.TanimotoSimilarity(fp1, fp2)
print(f"Tanimoto similarity: {similarity:.2f}")
```

## 3.4 Cheminformatics Toolkits

Several open-source toolkits provide cheminformatics functionality:

- **RDKit:**
	- Python/C++ library for molecular manipulation, descriptor calculation, and visualization.
	- [RDKit Documentation](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/)

- **Open Babel:**
	- Command-line and Python tools for converting between file formats and basic cheminformatics operations.
	- [Open Babel](https://openbabel.org/)

- **CDK (Chemistry Development Kit):**
	- Java library for cheminformatics, used in many bioinformatics tools.

These toolkits support reading/writing file formats, structure search, descriptor calculation, and more.
