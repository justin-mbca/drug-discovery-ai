# Target Identification

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the importance of target identification in drug discovery
- Use AI and NLP tools to mine biomedical literature for targets
- Access and analyze public databases (e.g., UniProt, PubMed)
- Implement a basic target mining workflow in Python
- Evaluate the quality and druggability of identified targets

## Introduction
Target identification is the first critical step in the drug discovery pipeline. Advances in AI and natural language processing (NLP) have made it possible to mine vast biomedical literature and databases to uncover novel drug targets efficiently.

## Core Concepts
- What makes a good drug target?
- Data sources: UniProt, PubMed, Open Targets
- AI/NLP for literature mining (e.g., BioBERT, PubMedBERT)
- Target validation and prioritization

## Hands-On Implementation
```python
# Install transformers and biopython
!pip install transformers biopython

from transformers import pipeline
from Bio import Entrez

# Example: Use Hugging Face pipeline for NER on biomedical text
nlp = pipeline("ner", model="d4data/biobert-ner")
text = "APP and BACE1 are key targets in Alzheimer's disease."
results = nlp(text)
print(results)

# Example: Search PubMed for Alzheimer's targets
Entrez.email = "your.email@example.com"
handle = Entrez.esearch(db="pubmed", term="Alzheimer target", retmax=5)
record = Entrez.read(handle)
print("PubMed IDs:", record["IdList"])
```

## Case Study / Real-World Example
Researchers used BioBERT to mine PubMed abstracts and identified novel protein targets for neurodegenerative diseases, leading to new therapeutic hypotheses.

## Common Challenges & Solutions
- Ambiguity in gene/protein names
- Data overload from literature mining
- Validating computationally identified targets

## Learning Tasks
- Run NER on abstracts for a disease of your choice
- Retrieve and summarize 3 recent PubMed articles on target discovery
- List criteria for prioritizing drug targets

## Tools & Libraries
- Hugging Face Transformers
- BioPython
- PubMed API

Installation:
```bash
pip install transformers biopython
```

## Summary
AI-powered literature mining accelerates target identification, but careful validation and prioritization are essential for success in drug discovery.
