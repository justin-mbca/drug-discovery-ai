# Chapter 7: Bioactivity Prediction

---

## Summary

Predicting the biological activity of molecules is central to drug discovery. This chapter covers data sources, machine learning models, and evaluation strategies for bioactivity prediction, including how to prepare data and assess model performance.

## Key Code Snippets

### 1. Load Bioactivity Data from ChEMBL
```python
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client
activity = new_client.activity
acts = activity.filter(target_chembl_id="CHEMBL25", standard_type="IC50")
for a in list(acts)[:5]:
	print(a['molecule_chembl_id'], a['standard_value'])
```

### 2. Train a Classifier for Bioactivity
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = ...  # feature matrix
y = ...  # binary activity labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Accuracy:", clf.score(X_test, y_test))
```
