# Chapter 2: Environment Setup

This chapter guides you through setting up a reproducible computational environment for AI-driven drug discovery, including Python, Jupyter, and essential libraries.

## 2.1 Installing Python and Conda

To get started, you need Python and a package manager. Conda is recommended for managing environments and dependencies.

**Steps:**

1. **Download and Install Miniconda:**
	- Go to [Miniconda Downloads](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and download the installer for your OS.
	- Run the installer and follow the prompts.

2. **Verify Installation:**
	- Open a terminal and run:
	  ```bash
	  conda --version
	  ```
	- You should see the conda version printed.

3. **Create a New Environment:**
	- Example for Python 3.10:
	  ```bash
	  conda create -n drug-discovery python=3.10
	  conda activate drug-discovery
	  ```

## 2.2 Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are essential for interactive coding and documentation.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Jupyter:**
	```bash
	conda install jupyterlab
	```

2. **Launch JupyterLab:**
	```bash
	jupyter lab
	```
	- This will open JupyterLab in your browser.

3. **Create a New Notebook:**
	- In JupyterLab, click "Python 3" under the Notebook section to start a new notebook.

## 2.3 Managing Dependencies

Managing dependencies ensures reproducibility and avoids conflicts.

**Best Practices:**

- Use `conda` or `pip` to install packages:
  ```bash
  conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn
  pip install rdkit matplotlib
  ```
- Export your environment for sharing:
  ```bash
  conda env export > environment.yml
  ```
- Recreate an environment from a file:
  ```bash
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

## 2.4 Version Control with Git

Version control is critical for tracking changes and collaborating.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Git:**
	- Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and follow installation instructions for your OS.

2. **Configure Git:**
	```bash
	git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
	```

3. **Initialize a Repository:**
	```bash
	git init
	```

4. **Basic Workflow:**
	```bash
	git add .
	git commit -m "Initial commit"
	git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
	git push -u origin main
	```
