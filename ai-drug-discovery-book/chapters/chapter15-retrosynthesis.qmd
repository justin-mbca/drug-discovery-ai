# Chapter 15: Retrosynthesis

Retrosynthesis planning is essential for proposing synthetic routes to molecules. This chapter covers rule-based and AI-driven retrosynthesis tools and strategies.

## 15.1 Introduction to Retrosynthesis

Retrosynthesis is the process of deconstructing a target molecule into simpler precursor structures, working backward from the product to available starting materials. It is a key strategy in organic synthesis and drug development.

- **Key Concepts:**
	- Identify strategic bonds to break (disconnections).
	- Propose sequences of reactions to build the target molecule from simpler compounds.
	- Use chemical knowledge, reaction databases, and computational tools.

## 15.2 Rule-Based Approaches

Rule-based retrosynthesis uses encoded chemical rules and reaction templates to suggest possible disconnections and synthetic routes.

- **How It Works:**
	- Reaction rules are derived from known chemical transformations.
	- The system applies these rules recursively to break down the target molecule.

- **Popular Tools:**
	- **LHASA:** One of the earliest expert systems for retrosynthesis.
	- **Chematica (Synthia):** Commercial platform with a large rule database.
	- **RDKit:** Open-source cheminformatics toolkit with basic retrosynthesis capabilities.

- **Advantages:**
	- Transparent and interpretable routes.
	- Leverages established chemical knowledge.

- **Limitations:**
	- Limited by the coverage of encoded rules.
	- May miss novel or unconventional pathways.

## 15.3 AI-Driven Retrosynthesis

AI-driven retrosynthesis uses machine learning and deep learning to predict synthetic routes, often learning directly from reaction databases.

- **Template-Based Models:**
	- Use reaction templates extracted from data, similar to rule-based systems but with automated extraction and ranking.

- **Template-Free Models:**
	- Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models treat retrosynthesis as a translation problem (product to reactants).
	- Graph neural networks (GNNs) model molecular graphs for reaction prediction.

- **Popular AI Tools:**
	- **ASKCOS:** Open-source platform using neural networks for retrosynthesis.
	- **IBM RXN:** Cloud-based AI retrosynthesis tool.
	- **AiZynthFinder:** Open-source tool for automated retrosynthetic planning.

- **Advantages:**
	- Can generalize to novel reactions and pathways.
	- Continuously improve with more data.

- **Limitations:**
	- May generate less interpretable routes.
	- Dependent on quality and diversity of training data.

## 15.4 Evaluating Synthetic Routes

Evaluating proposed synthetic routes is crucial for practical application:

- **Criteria:**
	- Number of steps (shorter is often better).
	- Availability and cost of starting materials.
	- Feasibility and reliability of each reaction step.
	- Overall yield and scalability.

- **Scoring and Ranking:**
	- Many tools provide scores based on route length, confidence, or synthetic accessibility.

- **Experimental Validation:**
	- Ultimately, routes must be tested in the lab to confirm feasibility.
