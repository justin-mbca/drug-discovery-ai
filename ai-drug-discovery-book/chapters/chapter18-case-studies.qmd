# Chapter 18: Case Studies

Real-world case studies demonstrate the application of AI and cheminformatics in drug discovery. This chapter presents selected examples and lessons learned.

## 18.1 Case Study 1: ALS Drug Discovery

**Background:**
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with limited treatment options. AI-driven approaches have been used to identify new therapeutic candidates.

- **Data Collection:**
	- Integrated omics data, literature mining, and known ALS-related targets.
	- Used cheminformatics to curate compound libraries for screening.

- **Virtual Screening:**
	- Applied machine learning models to predict neuroprotective activity.
	- Used molecular docking to prioritize compounds for SOD1 and TDP-43 protein targets.

- **Experimental Validation:**
	- Top candidates were tested in cell-based assays for neuroprotection.

- **Outcome:**
	- Identified several promising compounds for further development.

## 18.2 Case Study 2: Kinase Inhibitors

**Background:**
Kinases are important drug targets in cancer and other diseases. AI and cheminformatics have accelerated the discovery of selective kinase inhibitors.

- **Data Integration:**
	- Combined chemical structure data, kinase activity profiles, and protein-ligand interaction data.

- **QSAR Modeling:**
	- Built machine learning models to predict kinase inhibition based on molecular fingerprints and descriptors.

- **Structure-Based Design:**
	- Used docking and molecular dynamics to optimize binding affinity and selectivity.

- **Lead Optimization:**
	- Applied multi-parameter optimization to balance potency, selectivity, and ADMET properties.

- **Outcome:**
	- Accelerated identification of novel kinase inhibitors with improved profiles.

## 18.3 Lessons Learned

- **Data Quality Matters:**
	- High-quality, well-curated data is essential for successful AI-driven drug discovery.

- **Integration is Key:**
	- Combining multiple data types and methods yields better results than using a single approach.

- **Iterative Process:**
	- Drug discovery is iterative—models and hypotheses should be refined as new data becomes available.

- **Collaboration:**
	- Success often requires collaboration between computational scientists, chemists, and biologists.

- **Limitations:**
	- AI models are only as good as their training data and may not generalize to novel targets or chemotypes.
