# Chapter 17: End-to-End Pipeline

This chapter presents a complete AI-driven drug discovery pipeline, from data collection to candidate prioritization, integrating methods from previous chapters.

## 17.1 Pipeline Overview

An end-to-end AI-driven drug discovery pipeline integrates cheminformatics, machine learning, and structure-based methods to accelerate the identification of promising drug candidates.

- **Key Stages:**
	1. Data collection and curation
	2. Feature extraction and data preprocessing
	3. Model training and validation
	4. Virtual screening and candidate prioritization

## 17.2 Data Preparation

High-quality data is the foundation of any successful pipeline.

- **Data Sources:**
	- Public databases (e.g., ChEMBL, PubChem, PDB)
	- In-house experimental data

- **Data Curation:**
	- Remove duplicates, standardize chemical structures, and handle missing values.
	- Annotate data with relevant properties (e.g., activity, ADMET, target information).

- **Feature Engineering:**
	- Generate molecular fingerprints, descriptors, and graph representations.
	- Integrate multi-modal data (e.g., chemical, biological, clinical).

## 17.3 Model Training and Evaluation

Machine learning models are trained to predict properties such as bioactivity, ADMET, or binding affinity.

- **Model Selection:**
	- Choose appropriate algorithms (e.g., random forests, deep neural networks, graph neural networks, transformers).

- **Training:**
	- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.
	- Optimize hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

- **Evaluation:**
	- Use metrics such as ROC-AUC, RMSE, accuracy, and F1-score.
	- Perform cross-validation and external validation if possible.

- **Interpretability:**
	- Analyze feature importance and model explanations to gain insights.

## 17.4 Candidate Selection

The final stage is to prioritize candidates for experimental validation.

- **Virtual Screening:**
	- Screen large compound libraries using trained models and/or docking.
	- Rank compounds based on predicted activity, ADMET, and synthetic accessibility.

- **Filtering:**
	- Apply property-based and rule-based filters (e.g., Lipinski’s rules, toxicity filters).

- **Multi-Parameter Optimization:**
	- Balance potency, selectivity, safety, and developability.

- **Experimental Validation:**
	- Select top candidates for synthesis and biological testing.

- **Iterative Improvement:**
	- Incorporate new data and feedback to refine models and repeat the pipeline.
