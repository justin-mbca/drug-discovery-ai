# Chapter 17: Interpretability in AI for Drug Discovery

Interpretability is essential for building trust and extracting insights from AI models in drug discovery. This chapter discusses why interpretability matters, common techniques, and practical examples in cheminformatics and bioinformatics.

## 17.1 Why Interpretability?
- Regulatory and scientific needs
- Understanding model predictions

## 17.2 Techniques for Model Interpretation
- Feature importance (e.g., SHAP, LIME)
- Visualization of learned representations
- Case studies: interpreting molecular property models

## 17.3 Challenges and Best Practices
- Balancing accuracy and interpretability
- Pitfalls in interpreting complex models
