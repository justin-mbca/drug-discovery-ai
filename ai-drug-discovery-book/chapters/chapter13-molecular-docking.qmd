# Chapter 13: Molecular Docking

Molecular docking predicts how small molecules bind to protein targets. This chapter introduces docking theory, software, and practical workflows for virtual screening.

## 13.1 Docking Theory

Docking is a computational technique that predicts the preferred orientation of a small molecule (ligand) when bound to a protein (receptor). The goal is to estimate binding affinity and identify potential drug candidates.

- **Key Concepts:**
	- **Search Algorithm:** Explores possible ligand conformations and orientations in the binding site.
	- **Scoring Function:** Estimates the strength of the interaction (binding affinity) between ligand and protein.
	- **Rigid vs. Flexible Docking:** Rigid docking keeps the protein and ligand fixed; flexible docking allows movement in the ligand and/or protein.

## 13.2 Docking Software (AutoDock, Vina)

Several software packages are widely used for molecular docking:

- **AutoDock:**
	- One of the most popular open-source docking tools.
	- Uses Lamarckian genetic algorithm for conformational search.
	- Supports flexible ligand and some flexible side-chain docking.

- **AutoDock Vina:**
	- Improved version of AutoDock with faster performance and better scoring.
	- User-friendly and widely adopted for virtual screening.

- **Other Tools:**
	- DOCK, GOLD, Glide, and others are also used in academia and industry.

## 13.3 Preparing Structures for Docking

Proper preparation of protein and ligand structures is critical for successful docking:

- **Protein Preparation:**
	- Remove water molecules and irrelevant ligands.
	- Add missing atoms and assign correct protonation states.
	- Define the binding site (e.g., using known ligand or cavity detection).

- **Ligand Preparation:**
	- Generate 3D conformations.
	- Assign correct protonation and tautomeric states.
	- Minimize energy to relieve strain.

- **File Formats:**
	- PDBQT (AutoDock/Vina), MOL2, SDF, PDB.

## 13.4 Analyzing Docking Results

After docking, results must be analyzed to identify promising candidates:

- **Scoring and Ranking:**
	- Docking software provides binding affinity scores for each pose.
	- Rank compounds based on scores, but consider limitations of scoring functions.

- **Visual Inspection:**
	- Use molecular visualization tools (e.g., PyMOL, Chimera) to examine binding modes.
	- Check for key interactions (hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic contacts) and fit in the binding site.

- **Post-Processing:**
	- Cluster similar poses, filter by interaction criteria, and consider rescoring with more accurate methods if needed.

- **Experimental Validation:**
	- Top candidates should be validated experimentally for biological activity.
