# Genomics to Molecules

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to bridge genomics (genes/proteins) and cheminformatics (small molecules) in drug discovery
- Use public databases and Python tools to go from gene to protein to ligand
- Analyze molecular properties of drug-like compounds

## Introduction
Modern drug discovery often starts with genomics—identifying disease-relevant genes and proteins. The next step is to find or design small molecules that can modulate these targets. This chapter demonstrates a practical, stepwise workflow: from gene to protein to ligand to molecular property analysis, using real-world data and open-source tools.

## Step 1: Start from a Gene Symbol
We begin with a gene of interest. For example, the **APP** gene (Amyloid beta precursor protein) is associated with Alzheimer's disease.

## Step 2: Retrieve the Protein (UniProt)
We use the UniProt database to find the protein corresponding to our gene in humans.

```python
import requests
gene_symbol = 'APP'  # Amyloid beta precursor protein
uniprot_url = f'https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/search?query=gene_exact:{gene_symbol}+AND+organism_id:9606&fields=accession,protein_name,gene_names,organism_name,length&format=tsv'
resp = requests.get(uniprot_url)
print('UniProt search result:')
print(resp.text)
# Extract UniProt accession
lines = resp.text.strip().split('\n')
if len(lines) > 1:
    acc = lines[1].split('\t')[0]
    print(f'UniProt accession for APP: {acc}')
else:
    acc = None
    print('No UniProt entry found.')
```

## Step 3: Find Known Ligands for the Target (ChEMBL)
With the UniProt accession, we can search ChEMBL for known ligands (small molecules) that interact with this protein target.

```python
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client
target = new_client.target
activity = new_client.activity
if acc:
    # Find ChEMBL target for UniProt accession
    targets = target.filter(target_components__accession=acc)
    targets = list(targets)
    if targets:
        chembl_id = targets[0]['target_chembl_id']
        print(f'ChEMBL target ID: {chembl_id}')
        # Find bioactive molecules for this target
        acts = activity.filter(target_chembl_id=chembl_id, standard_type='IC50')
        print('Top 5 ligands with IC50:')
        ligands = []
        for a in list(acts)[:5]:
            mol_id = a.get('molecule_chembl_id', 'NA')
            ic50 = a.get('standard_value', 'NA')
            units = a.get('standard_units', '')
            print(f'Molecule: {mol_id}, IC50: {ic50} {units}')
            ligands.append(mol_id)
    else:
        print('No ChEMBL target found for this UniProt accession.')
else:
    print('No UniProt accession available for ligand search.')
```

## Step 4: Analyze a Ligand's Molecular Properties (RDKit)
Pick a ligand from the previous step (e.g., CHEMBL311039) and analyze its structure and properties.

```python
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
molecule = new_client.molecule
ligand_chembl_id = 'CHEMBL311039'  # Replace with a ligand from above if desired
mol_data = molecule.get(ligand_chembl_id)
smiles = mol_data.get('molecule_structures', {}).get('canonical_smiles', None)
print(f'Ligand {ligand_chembl_id} SMILES:', smiles)
if smiles:
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
    mw = Descriptors.MolWt(mol)
    logp = Descriptors.MolLogP(mol)
    print(f'Molecular Weight: {mw:.2f}')
    print(f'LogP: {logp:.2f}')
else:
    print('No SMILES found for this ligand.')
```

## Summary
This workflow demonstrates how to start from a gene, find the corresponding protein, retrieve known small-molecule ligands, and analyze their molecular properties. This bridges genomics and cheminformatics, enabling rational drug discovery starting from genetic information.

## Learning Tasks
- Try the workflow with a different gene (e.g., MAPT, BACE1, or a gene of your interest)
- Analyze the properties of several ligands and compare their drug-likeness
- Research a real-world example where genomics led to a new drug discovery

## Tools & Libraries
- RDKit
- pandas
- chembl_webresource_client
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook

Installation:
```bash
pip install rdkit-pypi pandas chembl_webresource_client jupyterlab
```
