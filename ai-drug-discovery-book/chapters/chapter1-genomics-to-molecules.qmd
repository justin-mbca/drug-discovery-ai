# Genomics to Molecules

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the parallels between genomics and drug discovery workflows
- Recognize the impact of AI in pharmaceutical research
- Set up a Python environment for drug discovery
- Explore the current landscape of AI-discovered drugs
- Perform basic cheminformatics operations in Python

## Introduction
The transition from genomics to drug discovery is a natural progression for data scientists. Both fields rely on large-scale data analysis, machine learning, and computational tools. With the advent of AI, especially breakthroughs like AlphaFold, the pharmaceutical industry is experiencing a revolution in how new drugs are discovered and developed.

## Core Concepts
- Genomics pipelines vs. drug discovery workflows
- The role of AI in modern pharma (AlphaFold, DeepMind, etc.)
- Overview of AI-discovered drugs in clinical trials
- Setting up your development environment (Python, Jupyter, RDKit, etc.)

## Hands-On Implementation
```python
# Install RDKit and other essentials
!pip install rdkit-pypi pandas

from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
import pandas as pd

# Example: Load a SMILES string and calculate properties
smiles = "CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O"  # Aspirin
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)

if mol:
    mw = Descriptors.MolWt(mol)
    logp = Descriptors.MolLogP(mol)
    print(f"Molecular Weight: {mw:.2f}")
    print(f"LogP: {logp:.2f}")
else:
    print("Invalid SMILES string.")
```

## Case Study / Real-World Example
AlphaFold's protein structure predictions have enabled rapid target identification for diseases. For example, researchers can now model protein-ligand interactions for novel targets in Alzheimer's disease, accelerating the path from genomics data to candidate molecules.

## Common Challenges & Solutions
- Data integration between genomics and cheminformatics
- Handling large datasets and computational resources
- Ensuring reproducibility in research workflows

## Learning Tasks
- Set up a Python environment with RDKit and Jupyter
- Load and analyze a list of SMILES strings from ChEMBL
- Research one AI-discovered drug currently in clinical trials and summarize its discovery process

## Tools & Libraries
- RDKit
- pandas
- Jupyter Lab/Notebook

Installation:
```bash
pip install rdkit-pypi pandas jupyterlab
```

## Summary
AI is bridging the gap between genomics and drug discovery, enabling faster, more accurate identification of drug candidates. Setting up a robust computational environment is the first step for hands-on exploration.
