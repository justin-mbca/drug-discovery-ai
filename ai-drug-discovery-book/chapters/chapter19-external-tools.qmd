# Chapter 19: External Tools

This chapter reviews external tools and databases commonly used in computational drug discovery, including RCSB PDB, ChEMBL, and PubChem.

## 19.1 Structural Databases

Structural databases provide 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids, and complexes, which are essential for structure-based drug design.

- **RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB):**
	- The primary repository for experimentally determined 3D structures of biological macromolecules.
	- [rcsb.org](https://www.rcsb.org/)
	- Structures are available in PDB and mmCIF formats.

- **AlphaFold Protein Structure Database:**
	- Provides predicted protein structures using deep learning.
	- [alphafold.ebi.ac.uk](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/)

- **Other Databases:**
	- PDB-REDO (refined structures), CATH/SCOP (structure classification).

## 19.2 Bioactivity Databases

Bioactivity databases contain information on small molecules, their biological activities, and targets.

- **ChEMBL:**
	- A large, open-access database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties.
	- Includes activity data (IC50, Ki, etc.), targets, and assay information.
	- [ebi.ac.uk/chembl](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)

- **PubChem:**
	- Comprehensive resource for chemical structures, properties, and biological activities.
	- Includes compound, substance, and bioassay databases.
	- [pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

- **BindingDB:**
	- Focuses on binding affinities for protein-ligand complexes.
	- [bindingdb.org](https://www.bindingdb.org/)

## 19.3 Workflow Automation Tools

Workflow automation tools streamline computational drug discovery by integrating multiple steps and tools into reproducible pipelines.

- **KNIME:**
	- Open-source platform for data analytics and workflow automation.
	- Widely used for cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and machine learning workflows.
	- [knime.com](https://www.knime.com/)

- **Pipeline Pilot:**
	- Commercial workflow automation tool for scientific data processing.
	- Supports cheminformatics, bioinformatics, and analytics.

- **Galaxy:**
	- Web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research.
	- [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/)

- **Snakemake/Nextflow:**
	- Workflow management systems for scalable and reproducible data analysis pipelines.

- **Integration with Scripting:**
	- Python, R, and shell scripts are often used to glue together custom workflows.
