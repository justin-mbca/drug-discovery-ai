# Chapter 12: Protein Structure

Understanding protein structure is key to structure-based drug design. This chapter covers protein structure basics, experimental methods, and computational prediction (e.g., AlphaFold).

## 12.1 Protein Structure Levels

Proteins have a hierarchical structure, each level contributing to their function:

- **Primary Structure:**
	- Linear sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain.
	- Determines all higher levels of structure.

- **Secondary Structure:**
	- Local folding patterns stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
	- Common motifs: α-helices and β-sheets.

- **Tertiary Structure:**
	- 3D arrangement of a single polypeptide chain, including side-chain interactions.
	- Stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, disulfide bonds, and ionic interactions.

- **Quaternary Structure:**
	- Assembly of multiple polypeptide chains (subunits) into a functional protein complex.

## 12.2 Experimental Determination

Experimental methods for determining protein structures include:

- **X-ray Crystallography:**
	- Most common method for high-resolution structures.
	- Requires crystallization of the protein.

- **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:**
	- Used for small to medium-sized proteins in solution.
	- Provides information on protein dynamics.

- **Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM):**
	- Suitable for large complexes and membrane proteins.
	- Does not require crystallization; recent advances have improved resolution.

## 12.3 Structure Prediction Tools

Computational tools can predict protein structures when experimental data is unavailable:

- **Homology Modeling:**
	- Builds models based on similarity to known structures (templates).
	- Tools: SWISS-MODEL, MODELLER.

- **Ab Initio Prediction:**
	- Predicts structure from sequence alone, without templates.
	- Computationally intensive; used for small proteins.

- **AlphaFold:**
	- Deep learning-based tool from DeepMind.
	- Achieves near-experimental accuracy for many proteins.

## 12.4 Protein-Ligand Interactions

Understanding how proteins interact with small molecules (ligands) is crucial for drug design:

- **Binding Sites:**
	- Specific regions on the protein where ligands bind.
	- Often located in pockets or grooves on the protein surface.

- **Interaction Types:**
	- Hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic bonds, van der Waals forces.

- **Docking and Scoring:**
	- Computational docking predicts how ligands fit into binding sites.
	- Scoring functions estimate binding affinity.

- **Applications:**
	- Lead discovery, optimization, and understanding mechanism of action.
