# Chapter 8: ADMET Prediction

---

## Summary

ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity) properties are critical for drug candidates. This chapter discusses computational approaches for ADMET prediction, including data sources, descriptors, and machine learning models.

## Key Code Snippets

### 1. Calculate ADMET Descriptors with RDKit
```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Crippen, Descriptors
smiles = "CCO"
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)
logp = Crippen.MolLogP(mol)
mw = Descriptors.MolWt(mol)
print(f"LogP: {logp}, MW: {mw}")
```

### 2. Predict Toxicity with a Pretrained Model (Example)
```python
# Example only: replace with actual model
import joblib
model = joblib.load('tox_model.pkl')
X = ...  # feature matrix
tox_pred = model.predict(X)
```

## 8.1 Introduction to ADMET
ADMET stands for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity. These properties determine whether a compound is likely to become a safe and effective drug. Poor ADMET characteristics are a major cause of drug candidate failure in clinical trials.

- **Absorption:** How well a drug is taken up into the bloodstream.
- **Distribution:** How the drug spreads through the body and tissues.
- **Metabolism:** How the drug is broken down, often by liver enzymes.
- **Excretion:** How the drug and its metabolites are eliminated.
- **Toxicity:** Potential for harmful effects.

## 8.2 Data and Descriptors
ADMET prediction relies on curated datasets and molecular descriptors that capture relevant chemical and biological properties.
- **Data sources:**
	- Public databases: ADMETlab, Tox21, ChEMBL, PubChem.
	- In-house experimental data.
- **Descriptors:**
	- Physicochemical: MW, logP, TPSA, H-bond donors/acceptors.
	- Structural: molecular fingerprints, substructure counts.
	- Biological: predicted or measured interactions with enzymes (e.g., CYP450).
- **Data curation:**
	- Standardize SMILES, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and balance classes.

## 8.3 ML Models for ADMET
Machine learning models are widely used for ADMET property prediction.
- **Classification models:** Predict binary outcomes (e.g., toxic vs. non-toxic, BBB permeable vs. not).
- **Regression models:** Predict continuous values (e.g., logD, clearance rate).
- **Popular algorithms:** Random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, deep learning (e.g., graph neural networks).
- **Model selection:** Depends on property, data size, and interpretability needs.
- **Multi-task learning:** Some models predict multiple ADMET endpoints simultaneously.

## 8.4 Interpreting ADMET Predictions
Interpreting model predictions is crucial for decision-making in drug discovery.
- **Performance metrics:** Accuracy, ROC-AUC, precision, recall, RMSE, etc.
- **Feature importance:** Identify which descriptors most influence predictions (e.g., SHAP values, permutation importance).
- **Applicability domain:** Assess whether a compound is within the model’s reliable prediction space.
- **Experimental validation:** Always confirm computational predictions with laboratory assays when possible.
