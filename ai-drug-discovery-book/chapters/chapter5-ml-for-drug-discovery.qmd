# Machine Learning for Drug Discovery

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of ML in drug discovery
- Prepare chemical and biological data for ML
- Build and evaluate classical ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)
- Apply ML to predict molecular properties
- Benchmark and interpret model performance

## Introduction
Machine learning (ML) is transforming drug discovery by enabling the prediction of molecular properties, bioactivity, and ADMET profiles from data. Both classical and deep learning approaches are used to accelerate the identification of promising drug candidates.

## Core Concepts
- Types of ML models: regression, classification, clustering
- Feature engineering for molecules (descriptors, fingerprints)
- Data splitting, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics
- Model interpretation and limitations

## Hands-On Implementation
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install scikit-learn rdkit-pypi pandas

from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Example: Predict molecular weight from SMILES (toy example)
data = {'smiles': ['CCO', 'CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O', 'CCN(CC)CCCC(C)NC1=C2C=CC(=CC2=NC=C1)Cl'],
        'property': [46.07, 180.16, 318.86]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df['mol'] = df['smiles'].apply(Chem.MolFromSmiles)
df['mw'] = df['mol'].apply(Descriptors.MolWt)

X = df[['mw']]
y = df['property']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, preds))
```

## Case Study / Real-World Example
A biotech company used Random Forest models to predict blood-brain barrier permeability, reducing the number of failed candidates in CNS drug development.

## Common Challenges & Solutions
- Data imbalance and bias
- Overfitting and generalization
- Feature selection and interpretability

## Learning Tasks
- Build a classifier to predict drug-likeness from molecular descriptors
- Compare performance of different ML algorithms
- Interpret feature importance in your model

## Tools & Libraries
- scikit-learn
- RDKit
- pandas

Installation:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn rdkit-pypi pandas
```

## Summary
ML enables rapid, data-driven decision making in drug discovery, but requires careful data preparation, model selection, and interpretation.
