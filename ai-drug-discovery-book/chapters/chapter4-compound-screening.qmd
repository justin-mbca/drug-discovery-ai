# Compound Screening

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the principles of virtual compound screening
- Use public compound databases (PubChem, ChEMBL)
- Implement basic compound search and filtering in Python
- Apply drug-likeness and ADMET filters
- Evaluate screening results for downstream analysis

## Introduction
Compound screening is a key step in drug discovery, enabling researchers to identify promising molecules from vast chemical libraries. Virtual screening, powered by cheminformatics and AI, accelerates this process and reduces experimental costs.

## Core Concepts
- Types of screening: high-throughput, virtual, fragment-based
- Public compound databases: PubChem, ChEMBL
- Drug-likeness and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity)
- Filtering and prioritization strategies

## Hands-On Implementation
```python
# Install required libraries
!pip install pubchempy chembl_webresource_client pandas

import pubchempy as pcp
from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client
import pandas as pd

# Example: Search PubChem for aspirin
compounds = pcp.get_compounds('aspirin', 'name')
for c in compounds:
    print(f"CID: {c.cid}, Canonical SMILES: {c.canonical_smiles}")

# Example: Search ChEMBL for approved drugs
molecule = new_client.molecule
approved_drugs = molecule.filter(max_phase=4)
for drug in approved_drugs[:5]:
    print(drug['molecule_chembl_id'], drug['pref_name'])
```

## Case Study / Real-World Example
Researchers used virtual screening to identify novel inhibitors for a cancer target, narrowing down from millions of compounds to a handful of candidates for experimental validation.

## Common Challenges & Solutions
- Data quality and consistency across databases
- Handling large result sets efficiently
- Integrating screening results with downstream workflows

## Learning Tasks
- Search for 10 compounds related to a disease of your choice in PubChem
- Filter a list of compounds by molecular weight and LogP
- Summarize the ADMET properties of 3 candidate molecules

## Tools & Libraries
- PubChemPy
- ChEMBL WebResource Client
- pandas

Installation:
```bash
pip install pubchempy chembl_webresource_client pandas
```

## Summary
Virtual compound screening is a powerful tool for narrowing down chemical space, but requires careful filtering and integration with biological data.
