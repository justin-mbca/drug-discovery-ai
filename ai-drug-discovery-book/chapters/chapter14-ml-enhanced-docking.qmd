# Chapter 14: ML-Enhanced Docking

Machine learning can improve docking accuracy and speed. This chapter discusses ML scoring functions, pose prediction, and integration with docking pipelines.

## 14.1 ML Scoring Functions

Traditional docking scoring functions are based on physics or empirical rules. Machine learning (ML) scoring functions use data-driven models to predict binding affinity more accurately.

- **Types of ML Scoring Functions:**
	- **Regression Models:** Predict binding affinity from features (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks).
	- **Deep Learning Models:** Use 3D protein-ligand structures as input (e.g., convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks).

- **Popular ML Scoring Tools:**
	- **RF-Score:** Random forest model using atom pair features.
	- **DeltaVina:** Combines ML with traditional Vina scoring.
	- **DeepDock, GNINA:** Deep learning-based scoring using 3D grids or graphs.

- **Advantages:**
	- Capture complex, non-linear interactions.
	- Can be retrained on new data for specific targets.

## 14.2 Pose Prediction

ML models can also predict the correct binding pose of a ligand in a protein binding site.

- **Pose Ranking:**
	- ML models can re-rank docking poses generated by traditional software, improving the selection of the most likely binding mode.

- **End-to-End Pose Prediction:**
	- Some deep learning models directly predict ligand poses from protein and ligand structures (e.g., EquiBind, DeepDock).

- **Evaluation:**
	- Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) is used to assess pose accuracy compared to experimental structures.

## 14.3 Integrating ML with Docking

ML can be integrated into docking pipelines to enhance virtual screening and lead optimization:

- **Hybrid Workflows:**
	- Use traditional docking to generate poses, then apply ML scoring for more accurate ranking.
	- Filter large libraries with fast ML models before detailed docking.

- **Active Learning:**
	- Iteratively improve ML models by incorporating feedback from new docking or experimental results.

- **Automation:**
	- ML models can automate hit selection, pose filtering, and prioritization in large-scale screens.

- **Example Workflow:**
	1. Dock a library of compounds using AutoDock Vina.
	2. Score top poses with a deep learning model (e.g., GNINA).
	3. Select candidates for experimental validation based on ML scores.
