# Chapter 11: Transformers in Chemistry

Transformers have revolutionized sequence modeling and are now applied to chemistry. This chapter explores transformer architectures for SMILES, reaction prediction, and property modeling.

## 11.1 Introduction to Transformers

Transformers are deep learning models based on self-attention mechanisms, originally developed for natural language processing (NLP). They excel at modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data and have become the foundation for state-of-the-art models in many domains.

- **Key Features:**
	- Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence.
	- Highly parallelizable and scalable to large datasets.
	- Examples: BERT, GPT, T5, and their chemistry adaptations.

## 11.2 SMILES Transformers

SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings are a common way to represent molecules as sequences. Transformers can be trained on SMILES data for various tasks:

- **SMILES Language Modeling:**
	- Learn the syntax and structure of valid SMILES strings.
	- Enable generative tasks such as de novo molecule generation.

- **Pretrained Models:**
	- ChemBERTa, SMILES-BERT, and other transformer models pretrained on large chemical databases.
	- Can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks like property prediction or reaction classification.

- **Example (Conceptual):**
	- Tokenize SMILES strings and train a transformer to predict the next token or reconstruct masked tokens.

## 11.3 Reaction Prediction

Transformers are used to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions by modeling reactants and products as sequences.

- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models:**
	- Encode reactant SMILES and decode product SMILES.
	- Trained on large reaction datasets (e.g., USPTO).

- **Applications:**
	- Forward reaction prediction: Given reactants, predict products.
	- Retrosynthesis: Given a product, predict possible reactants.

- **Advantages:**
	- Capture complex reaction patterns and context.
	- Outperform traditional rule-based systems in many cases.

## 11.4 Property Prediction

Transformers can be fine-tuned to predict molecular properties from SMILES or graph representations.

- **Approach:**
	- Pretrain a transformer on large chemical datasets.
	- Fine-tune on labeled data for specific properties (e.g., solubility, toxicity, activity).

- **Benefits:**
	- Leverage transfer learning for improved accuracy with limited labeled data.
	- Capture subtle structure-property relationships.

- **Example (Conceptual):**
	- Use a pretrained SMILES transformer to predict logP, binding affinity, or ADMET properties.
