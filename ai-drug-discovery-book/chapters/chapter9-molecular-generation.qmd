# Chapter 9: Molecular Generation

---

## Summary

Generative models can design novel molecules with desired properties. This chapter introduces molecular generation techniques, including SMILES-based and graph-based approaches, and discusses how to evaluate generated molecules.

---

## Key Code Snippets

### 1. Generate Molecules with a SMILES RNN (Example)
```python
# Example only: replace with actual model
import torch
model = ...  # pretrained RNN
z = torch.randn(1, latent_dim)
smiles = model.sample(z)
print(smiles)
```

### 2. Evaluate Validity of Generated SMILES
```python
from rdkit import Chem
smiles_list = ["CCO", "invalid_smiles"]
for s in smiles_list:
	mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(s)
	print(f"{s}: {'valid' if mol else 'invalid'}")
```
