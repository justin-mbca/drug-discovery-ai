# Network-Driven Strategy for Complex Diseases

This chapter introduces the use of biomedical networks and graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze complex diseases and prioritize drug candidates. The workflow integrates multi-agent orchestration and domain-specific LLMs to rank compounds for selected diseases.

## Key Steps
- Select disease and gene/protein targets
- Build and analyze disease network with GNNs
- Query compound databases
- Run multi-agent workflow (Design, Validation, Approval)
- Visualize and export results

See the demonstration notebook (`demo_workflow.ipynb`) for a practical example.
