    "title": "The effect of Apolipoprotein E4 on cognitive function in Parkinson's disease: A structural MRI study in the PPMI cohort.",
    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a genetic risk factor of Alzheimer's Disease, has been associated with PD-related cognitive impairment. However, findings are inconsistent, highlighting the need for further investigation. Neuroimaging studies have found gray matter abnormalities, mainly reductions in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CTh), in both cognitively impaired PD patients and APOE4 carriers. Yet, APOE4's role in these structural changes and their cognitive impact in PD is underexplored.",
