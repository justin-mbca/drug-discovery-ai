## 🌐 Simple Streamlit Frontend

You can interact with the Drug Discovery AI backend using a simple Streamlit web app. This provides an easy-to-use interface for entering queries and viewing results.

### Usage

1. Make sure your FastAPI backend is running (see Quick Start above).
2. Install Streamlit if you haven't already:
	```bash
	pip install streamlit
	```
3. Run the frontend:
	```bash
	streamlit run frontend.py
	```
4. Enter a disease, target, or compound in the web UI and view the results interactively.

The Streamlit app is located in `frontend.py`.


You can build a user-friendly frontend to interact with the Drug Discovery AI API. Here are some options and examples:

### 1. Simple Web Client (HTML/JS)

You can use a basic HTML/JavaScript page to send requests to the FastAPI backend:

```html
<form id="queryForm">
	<input type="text" id="query" placeholder="Enter compound name">
	<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<pre id="result"></pre>
<script>
document.getElementById('queryForm').onsubmit = async function(e) {
	e.preventDefault();
	const q = document.getElementById('query').value;
	const res = await fetch(`http://127.0.0.1:8000/full_workflow?query=${encodeURIComponent(q)}`);
	document.getElementById('result').textContent = await res.text();
};
</script>
```

### 2. Streamlit App (Python)

Create a simple Streamlit UI for local use:

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.title("Drug Discovery AI Assistant")
query = st.text_input("Enter compound name:")
if st.button("Submit"):
		response = requests.get(f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/full_workflow?query={query}")
		st.write(response.text)
```

### 3. Advanced Web UI (React, Next.js, etc.)

For a modern, user-friendly experience, build a custom frontend using React, Next.js, or similar frameworks. Example (React fetch call):

```javascript
fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8000/full_workflow?query=BACE1')
	.then(res => res.json())
	.then(data => setResult(data));
```

You can design interactive dashboards, result visualizations, and workflow management features tailored to your needs.

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Example: Discovering a Drug Candidate

Here’s how you can use the Drug Discovery AI pipeline for a real-world drug discovery scenario:

**Goal:** Identify and evaluate new drug candidates for Alzheimer’s disease (target: BACE1)

### 1. Start the Backend API
```bash
uvicorn app.example_main:app --reload
```

### 2. Submit a Query (e.g., via browser or curl)
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/full_workflow?query=BACE1"
```
Or use the interactive docs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

### 3. Review the Output
- **Discovery Agent:** Summarizes BACE1’s role in Alzheimer’s, retrieves relevant compounds and literature.
- **Design Agent:** Suggests and evaluates new compound designs, docking scores, and predicted properties.
- **Validation Agent:** Simulates lab/clinical validation, summarizes findings.
- **Approval Agent:** Generates a regulatory summary for the candidate.

### 4. Iterate and Refine
- Try different targets or compounds (e.g., "aspirin", "tau protein").
- Adjust agent prompts or models for more specific results.
- Integrate your own data or tools for deeper analysis.

### 5. (Optional) Build a Frontend
- Use the provided examples to create a web UI for easier interaction and visualization.




## 🧪 Step-by-Step Example Outputs

Here’s a real example showing the outputs at each step of the workflow for the query "Alzheimer disease":

### 1. 🧠 Discovery Agent
Input: `Alzheimer disease`
Output:
```json
{
	"literature": ["40886227", "40881622", "40881157"],
	"structure": "AlphaFold structure for Alzheimer disease not found online (status 404). Download manually from https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Alzheimer disease if needed.",
	"pubchem": {"error": "PubChem API error: 404 Client Error: PUGREST.NotFound for url: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/Alzheimer%20disease/property/MolecularWeight,MolecularFormula,IUPACName/JSON"},
	"llm_summary": "PubMedBERT summary (top predictions):\nalzheimer disease is associated with inflammation. (score: 0.143)\nalzheimer disease is associated with aging. (score: 0.093)\nalzheimer disease is associated with obesity. (score: 0.084)\nalzheimer disease is associated with neuroinflammation. (score: 0.064)\nalzheimer disease is associated with depression. (score: 0.035)",
	"suggested_targets": ["PET", "IEEE", "USA", "SUVR", "ADNI"]
}
```

### 2. 🧬 Design Agent

Output:
```json
{
	"regulatory_summary": "Meets FDA requirements.",
	...
}
```

---

Test the full workflow (all stages):

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/full_workflow?query=BACE1"
```

Test individual stages:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/discovery?query=BACE1"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/design?compound=aspirin"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/validation?candidate=aspirin"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/approval?candidate=aspirin"
```


### 🧬 Disease Sample Queries

#### Example: DiscoveryAgent with BioBERT NER Extraction

You can run the DiscoveryAgent directly in Python to test disease-to-target extraction using BioBERT NER (with fallback to regex):

```python
from agents.discovery_agent import DiscoveryAgent
result = DiscoveryAgent().run('Alzheimer disease')
print(result)
```

**Sample Output:**

```
{
	'literature': ['40886227', '40881622', '40881157'],
	'structure': 'AlphaFold structure for Alzheimer disease not found online (status 404). Download manually from https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/Alzheimer disease if needed.',
	'pubchem': {'error': 'PubChem API error: 404 Client Error: PUGREST.NotFound for url: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/rest/pug/compound/name/Alzheimer%20disease/property/MolecularWeight,MolecularFormula,IUPACName/JSON'},
	'llm_summary': 'PubMedBERT summary (top predictions):\nalzheimer disease is associated with inflammation. (score: 0.143)\nalzheimer disease is associated with aging. (score: 0.093)\nalzheimer disease is associated with obesity. (score: 0.084)\nalzheimer disease is associated with neuroinflammation. (score: 0.064)\nalzheimer disease is associated with depression. (score: 0.035)',
	'suggested_targets': ['PET', 'IEEE', 'USA', 'SUVR', 'ADNI']
}
```

This confirms that BioBERT NER-based target extraction is working. The `suggested_targets` field contains entities extracted from PubMed abstracts using BioBERT (with fallback to regex if needed).

---

You can start the workflow with a disease name. The system will suggest relevant protein/gene targets for further exploration:

```bash
# Alzheimer's disease (will suggest targets like BACE1, APP, MAPT, etc.)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/discovery?query=Alzheimer's disease"

# Parkinson's disease
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/discovery?query=Parkinson's disease"

# Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/discovery?query=ALS"

# Pancreatic cancer
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/discovery?query=pancreatic cancer"
```

You can then use the suggested targets as queries for the full workflow or design endpoints.

**Note:** When a protein structure is needed and not found locally, the app will automatically download the precomputed 3D structure from the AlphaFold EBI database.

---
